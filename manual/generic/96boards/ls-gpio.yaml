    environment:
        - manual-test

run:
    steps:
        - Boot the board successfuly to console.
        - Install libgpiod along with its userspace tools.
        - Toggle the GPIOs {A-L} on the low speed header using gpioset utility.
        - Connect 1.8v/GND sources to the GPIOs {A-L} and capture the polarity using gpioget utility

    expected:
        - The polarity of the GPIOs will change as per the value specified in gpioset. 1 = HIGH, 0 = LOW
        - The captured polarity value should match the voltage level applied to the GPIOs.
